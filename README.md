# Next + Tailwind Template

This is a Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example setup with some small examples to get started. To duplicate this repository to use for your own project, run the following command inside your terminal:

```bash
npx degit quelchx/next.tailwind my-project
cd my-project && npm install
```

This will use the degit package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/degit) to grab his repository for your own use. If you wish to make your own version of this configuration, please `fork` this repo.

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v2.2)](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-2-2) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

It uses the new [`Just-in-Time Mode`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) for Tailwind CSS.
